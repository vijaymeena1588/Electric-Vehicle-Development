# Electric-Vehicle-Development

Revived and successfully completed VITâ€™s first off-road electric vehicle project, which had been on hold for 5 years.  
As the **Lead Electrical Head**, I was responsible for designing and implementing the EV circuitry, managing a 60V DC system, and ensuring interconnection safety locks in compliance with SAE eBAJA rulebook standards.  
Additionally, I coordinated electrical subsystem integration, safety checks, and testing.  

Represented the team at **BAJA SAEINDIA 2025 (eBAJA)** and led technical discussions with judges, successfully clearing the on-site vehicle inspection for approval.  
The project outcome was a **fully functional and competition-ready off-road EV Car**.
