# Electric-Vehicle-Development
Revived and successfully completed VITâ€™s first off-road electric vehicle project, which had been on hold for 5 years. As the Lead Electrical Head, I was responsible for designing and implementing the EV circuitry, managing a 60V DC system, and ensuring interconnection safety locks in compliance with SAE eBAJA rulebook standards. Additionally, I coordinated electrical subsystem integration, safety checks, and testing. Represented the team at BAJA SAEINDIA 2025 (eBAJA) and led technical discussions with judges, successfully clearing the on-site vehicle inspection for approval. The project outcome was a fully functional and competition-ready off-road EV prototype.
